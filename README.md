About
-----
This plugin lists all series and all books in each series. The order of the series is determined by the number of books in the series. The books are presented in alphabetical order. In the settings, you can choose:
a) whether images are to be displayed in the accordion content area next to the book list and as icons for the series list. If there are books in a series, the cover of the most recent book is used (dates are taken from section "Publication dates", role "Publication date", publication format "PDF). If there are no books in a series or the date is not set in the appropriate way, the series covers are used.
b) wether to display the series cover on the individual series pages
This is the LangSci version of this plugin: The style of the series page is slightly adapted (hide breadcrumbs, bigger headings, etc.).
